# m68k
A over ambitious project to build a usable computer from scratch. Based on bits and pieces from the interwebb, but with my own twists and turns.

Initial hardware:
- CPU: MC68010@12MHz
- DUART: MC68681
- A bunch of 74LS/HCT chips
- A bunch of breadboards
- Some GAL's to replace discrete glue logic in the end

## Version info
0.1.2 - Milestone. I finally got the grips on gcc and linkerscripts. Building and object dump now generates binary file with an valid reset vector

0.1.1 - Milestone. Got a fre running CPU stepping through memory and blinking leds, by tying databus to ground (all zeros)
